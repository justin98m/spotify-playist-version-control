# SpotifyPlaylistVs

A simple web application that will allow you to save versions of your Spotify Playlists so any instance of a specific playlist can be reinstantiated.

I came up with the idea when i realiezed I was making multiple versions of playlists I had in order not to lose the older/outdated version playlist.
For example if I have a plalist called "Chilling" 
The music I was "Chilling" to five years ago is different to the music I chill to now. I don't want to make a Chilling II nor do I want to delete the history of 
what I was chilling to five years ago. So here is my niche solution for my very niche problem.


This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.9.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
